## Goals

Data wrangling (manipulation, ninjery, cleaning, etc.) is the part of any data analysis that will take the most time. While it may not necessarily be fun, it is foundational to all the work that follows. I strongly believe that mastering these skills has more value than mastering a particular analysis.  Check out [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html) if you don't believe me.

We'll have two hours to cover parts 1 and 2 of data wrangling. It’s an unrealistic expectation that you will be a ninja wrangler after this training. As such, the goals are to expose you to fundamentals and to develop an appreciation of what’s possible. I also want to provide resources that you can use for follow-up learning on your own.

After this lesson you should be able to answer (or be able to find answers to) the following:

* Why do we need to manipulate data?
* What is the tidyverse?
* What can you do with dplyr?
* What is piping?

## The tidyverse

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and design. The tidyverse package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the tidyverse in a single command. With tidyverse, you'll be able to address all steps of data exploration.

![](figure/data-science.png)

From the excellent book, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), **data exploration** is the art of looking at your data, rapidly generating hypotheses, quickly testing them, then repeating again and again and again.  Tools in the tidyverse also have direct application to more formal analyses with many of the other available R packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

You should already have the tidyverse installed, but let's give it a go if you haven't done this part yet:

```{r eval = F}
# install
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

After installation, we can load the package:
```{r message = T}
# load
library(tidyverse)
```

Notice that the messages you get after loading are a bit different from other packages.  That's because tidyverse is a package that manages other packages.  Loading tidyverse will load all of the core packagbes:

-   [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), for data visualisation.
-   [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data manipulation.
-   [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org), for data tidying.
-   [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org), for data import.
-   [purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org), for functional programming.
-   [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org), for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.

Other packages (e.g., `readxl`) are also included but you will probably not use these as frequently.

A nice freature of tidyverse is the ability to check for and install new versions of each package:

``` r
tidyverse_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * broom (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * DBI   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * Rcpp  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#>
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```

As you'll soon learn using R, there are often several ways to achieve the same goal.  The tidyverse provides tools to address problems that can be solved with other packages or even functions from the base installation.  Tidyverse is admittedly an *opinionated* approach to data exploration, but it's popularity and rapid growth within the R community is a testament to the power of the tools that are provided.

## Data wrangling with `dplyr`

![](figure/data-science-wrangle.png)

The data wrangling process includes data import, tidying, and transformation.  The process directly feeds into, and is not mutually exclusive, with the *understanding* or modelling side of data exploration.  More generally, I consider data wrangling as the manipulation or combination of datasets for the purpose of analysis.

Wrangling begins with import and ends with an output of some kind, such as a plot or a model.  In a perfect world, the wrangling process is linear with no need for back-tracking.  In reality, we often uncover more information about a dataset, either through wrangling or modeling, that warrants re-evaluation or even gathering more data.  Data also come in many forms and the form you need for analysis is rarely the required form of the input data.  For these reasons, data wrangling will consume most of your time in data exploration.

**All wrangling is based on a purpose.**  No one wrangles for the sake of wrangling (usually), so the process always begins by answering the following two questions:

* What do my input data look like?
* What should my input data look like given what I want to do?

At the most basic level, going from what your data looks like to what it should look like will require a few key operations.  Some common examples:

* Selecting specific variables
* Filtering observations by some criteria
* Adding or modifying existing variables
* Renaming variables
* Arranging rows by a variable
* Summarizing variable conditional on others

The `dplyr` package provides easy tools for these common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames and this is one of the foundational packages in what is now known as the tidyverse. The philosophy of dplyr is that one function does one thing and the name of the function says what it does. This is where the tidyverse generally departs from other packages and even base R.  It is meant to be easy, logical, and intuitive.  There is a lot of great info on dplyr. If you have an interest, I’d encourage you to look more. The vignettes are particularly good.

* [CRAN page: vignettes here](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/)
* [Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

I'll demonstrate the examples with the `fishdat` dataset from the last lesson. This dataset includes over 30000 catch records of fish from Old Tampa Bay.

```{r}
# import the data
fishdat <- read_csv('data/fishdat.csv')

# see first six rows
head(fishdat)

# dimensions
dim(fishdat)

# column names
names(fishdat)

# structure
str(fishdat)
```

### Selecting

Let's begin using dplyr. Don't forget to load the tidyverse if you haven't done so already.  We can use the `select` function to, you guess it, select columns.  

```{r}
# first, select some columns
dplyr_sel1 <- select(fishdat, Sampling_Date, Gear, Pinfish)
head(dplyr_sel1)

# select everything but ObjectId and ExDate
dplyr_sel2 <- select(fishdat, -OBJECTID, -ExDate)
head(dplyr_sel2)

# select columns that contain the letter c
dplyr_sel3 <- select(fishdat, matches('c'))
head(dplyr_sel3)
```

### Filtering

After selecting columns, you'll probably want to remove observations that don't fit some criteria.  For example, maybe you want to remove all rows with low catch or maybe you want to look only at fish caught in Gear 20 (a 21 m seine net). 

```{r}
# now filter observations with more than 20 fish caught
dplyr_high_catch <- filter(fishdat, Mullets > 20)
head(dplyr_high_catch)

# now filter observations for Gear type as 20
dplyr_gear20 <- filter(fishdat, Gear == 20)
head(dplyr_gear20)
```

Filtering can take a bit of time to master because there are several ways to tell R what you want. Within the filter function, the working part is a *logical selection* of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values that are used to selected rows (`TRUE` means I want that row, `FALSE` means I don't).  Every selection within the filter function, no matter how complicated, will always be a T/F vector.  This is similar to running queries on a database if you're familiar with SQL.

To use filtering effectively, you have to know how to select the observations that you want using the comparison operators. R provides the standard suite: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). When you're starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use `=` instead of `==` when testing for equality.

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with "and": every expression must be true in order for a row to be included in the output. For other types of combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators yourself: `&` is "and", `|` is "or", and `!` is "not". This is the complete set of Boolean operations.

![](figure/transform-logical.png)

Let's start combining filtering operations.

```{r}
# get rows with > 20 but less than 100 fish
filt1 <- filter(fishdat, Mullets > 20 & Mullets < 100)
head(filt1)

# get rows with gear type 20 or blue crab
filt2 <- filter(fishdat, Gear == 20 | `Red Drum` > 40)
head(filt2)

# get rows with Bluefish and Mullets
filt3 <- filter(fishdat, Gear == 20 | Gear == 5)
head(filt3)

# get rows with Bluefish and Mullets
filt4 <- filter(fishdat, Gear %in% c(20, 5))
head(filt4)
```

As a side note, any variable (i.e., column name) with spaces or non-standard characters can be referenced by enclosing it with backticks (see [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html#binding)).

### Mutating

Now that we've seen how to filter observations and select columns of a data frame, maybe we want to add a new column. In dplyr, `mutate` allows us to add new columns. These can be vectors you are adding or based on expressions applied to existing columns. For instance, we have a column for average size in mm and maybe we want to convert to cm. 

```{r}
# add a column as bluefish divided by 100
dplyr_mut <- mutate(fishdat, Bluefish_p100 = Bluefish / 100)
head(dplyr_mut)

# add a column for many/few mullet
dplyr_mut2 <- mutate(fishdat, mullet_cat = ifelse(Mullets < 20, 'few', 'many'))
head(dplyr_mut2)
```

Some other useful dplyr functions include `arrange` to sort the observations (rows) by a column and `rename` to (you guessed it) rename a column.

```{r}
# arrange by maximum size
dplyr_arr <- arrange(fishdat, `Sand Seatrout`)
head(dplyr_arr)

# rename some columns
dplyr_rnm <- rename(fishdat, snook = `Common Snook`)
head(dplyr_rnm)
```

There are many more functions in `dplyr` but the one's above are by far the most used.  As you can imagine, they are most effective when used to together because there is never only one step in the data wrangling process.  After the exercise, we'll talk about how we can efficiently *pipe* the functions in dplyr to create a new data object.

## Exercise 1

Now that you know the basic functions in `dplyr` and how to use them, let's put them to use.  Using `fishdat`, let's select some columns of interest, filter by species and gear type, filter only large catches, and arrange in ascending order.

1.  Remove all but the `Reference`, `Sampling_Date`, `Gear`, `Commonname`, and `Pinfish` columns.  Assign this dataset to a new object in your workspace.

1. Using the new object, filter again to get only Sand Seatrout and Pinfish caugth with Gear 20 (hint, filter by the `Gear` column` and don't forget ot use `==`). 

1. Rename the `Sampling_Date` column to `date`. 

1. When you're done, type the number of rows in your dataset into the group chat. 

<div class="fold s o">
```{r, eval = F}
ex1 <- select(fishdat, Reference, Sampling_Date, Gear, Pinfish)
ex1 <- filter(ex1, Gear == 20)
ex1 <- rename(ex1, date = Sampling_Date)
nrow(ex1)
```
</div>

## Piping

A complete data wrangling exercise will always include multiple steps to go from the raw data to the output you need. Here's a terrible wrangling example using functions from base R:

```{r base, eval=FALSE}
cropdat <- rawdat[1:28]
savecols <- data.frame(cropdat$Party, cropdat$`Last Inventory Year (2015)`)
names(savecols) <- c('Party','2015')
savecols$rank2015 <- rank(-savecols$`2015`)
top10df <- savecols[savecols$rank2015 <= 10,]
basedat <- cropdat[cropdat$Party %in% top10df$Party,]
```

Technically, if this works it's not "wrong", but there are a couple issues that can lead to problems down the line. First, the flow of functions to manipulate the data is not obvious and this makes your code very hard to read. Second, lots of unecessary intermediates have been created in your workspace.  Anything that adds to clutter should be avoided because R is fundamentally based on object assignments.  The less you assign as a variable in your environment the easier it will be to navigate complex scripts.

The good news is that you now know how to use the dplyr functions to wrangle data.  The function names in dplyr were chosen specifically to be descriptive.  This will make your code much more readable than if you were using base R counterparts.  The bad news is that I haven't told you how to easily link the functions.  Fortunately, there's an easy fix to this problem.

The `magrittr` package (comes with tidyverse) provides a very useful method called *piping* that will make wrangling a whole lot easier.  The idea is simple: a pipe (`%>%`) is used to chain functions together.  The output from one function becomes the input to the next function in the pipe. This avoids the need to create intermediate objects and creates a logical progression of steps that demystify the wrangling process.

Consider the simple example:

```{r}
# not using pipes, select a column, filter rows
bad_ex <- select(fishdat, Gear, `Common Snook`)
bad_ex2 <- filter(bad_ex, `Common Snook` > 25)
```

With pipes, it looks like this:

```{r}
# with pipes, select a column, filter rows
good_ex <- fishdat %>% 
  select(Gear, `Common Snook`) %>%
  filter(`Common Snook` > 25)
```

Now we've created only one new object in our environment and we can clearly see that we select, then filter.  The only real coding difference is now the select and filter functions only include the relevant information.  You do not need to specify a data object as input to a function if you're using piping. The pipe will always use the input that comes from above.

A couple comments about piping:

* I find it very annoying to type the pipe operator (six key strokes!).  RStudio has a nice keyboard shortcut: `Crtl + Shift + M` for Windows (use `Cmd + Shift + M` on a mac).
* It's convention to start a new function on the next line after a pipe operator.  This makes the code easier to read and you can also comment out a single step in a long pipe.
* Don't make your pipes too long, limit them to a particular data object or task.

## Exercise 2

Now that we know how to pipe functions, let's repeat exercise 1.  You should already have code to select and filter the data. Use the following to repeate the analysis but with pipes.  You should only have to create one data object in this exercise. 

1. Using your code from exercise two, try to replicate the steps using pipes.  The steps we used in exercise two were:
     * From fishdat, select the `Reference`, `Sampling_Date`, `Gear`, and `Pinfish` columns
     * Filter by `Gear` to get only gear 20
     * Rename `Smapling_Date` to `date`

2. When you're done, you should have a data object that's exactly the same as the one you created in exercise two. Try to verify this with the `identical` function from base R (check the help file with `?identical` if you don't know how to use this function).

<div class="fold s o">
```{r, eval = F}
ex2 <- fishdat %>% 
  select(Reference, Reference, Sampling_Date, Gear, Pinfish) %>% 
  filter(Gear == 20) %>% 
  rename(date = Sampling_Date)
identical(ex1, ex2)
```
</div>

## Next time

Now you should be able to answer (or be able to find answers to) the following:

* Why do we need to manipulate data?
* What is the tidyverse?
* What can you do with dplyr?
* What is piping?

Next we'll continue with data wrangling.
