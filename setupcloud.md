# Set Up

Thanks for your interest in learning R.  For the workshop, we will be using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as our interface to R. [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) allows you to access RStudio and R using a web browser and you will not have to install the software on your personal computer.  Please note that is ideal for teaching, but installing your own version is strongly recommended for using R after the workshop.  Please see the instructions [here](setup.html) to install on your personal computer.
